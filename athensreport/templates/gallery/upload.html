          "Athens Report" seeks your participation to build a collective bottom-up project which,
          by filing personal experiences in video format, will contribute to re-representation of
          the years of recession and austerity in Athens against the dominant representation through
          the traditional media.

          Upload your videos in any format and quality. The material should record events that
          occurred on the axis of the route of the trolley # 11.
